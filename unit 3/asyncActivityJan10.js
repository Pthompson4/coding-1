//1. Create 3 different lists data types that will include things found in grocery store. Make sure your items use the string data type.


+
// Create a list that includes 5 items that you can find in the frozen food isle.  
["Frozen pizza", "frozen vegetables", "frozen fruit", "frozen waffles", "ice cream"]
// Create a list that includes 5 items that you can find in the international food isle.
["kimchi", "ramen", "sushi", "taco shells","siracha"]
// Create a list that includes 5 items that you can find in the produce isle.
["apples", "bananas","grapes", "celery", "tomatoes"]



//2. With the list provided below; use the print (for python) or console.log (for javascript)
//  functions to return the correct value for the index.
numbers = [1,30,39,50,293,100]

Hint: If you get stuck, search for accessing JS list by index or accessing Python
 list by index depending on which language you are learning

print/ console.log the number at index 0
print/ console.log the number at index 3
print/ console.log the number at index 4




//3. Create a function that will multiply the number at index 4 in the list above.
