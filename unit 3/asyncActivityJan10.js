//1. Create 3 different lists data types that will include things found in grocery store. Make sure your items use the string data type.


//a list is a data type that can be used to group and collect other data types in one variable

// Create a list that includes 5 items that you can find in the frozen food isle.  
var frozenFood = ['Frozen pizza', 'frozen vegetables', 'frozen fruit', 'frozen waffles', 'ice cream']

// Create a list that includes 5 items that you can find in the international food isle.
var internationalFood = ['kimchi', 'ramen', 'soy sauce', 'taco shells','siracha']

// Create a list that includes 5 items that you can find in the produce isle.
var produceFoods = ['apples', 'bananas','grapes', 'celery', 'tomatoes']



//2. With the list provided below; use the print (for python) or console.log (for javascript)
//  functions to return the correct value for the index.
numbers = [1,30,39,50,293,100]

Hint: If you get stuck, search for accessing JS list by index or accessing Python
 list by index depending on which language you are learning

print/ console.log the number at index 0
1
print/ console.log the number at index 3
50

print/ console.log the number at index 4
293



//3. Create a function that will multiply the number at index 4 in the list above.
funtion multiplier (x) {
    //console.log(x * 293);
    //console.log(x * numbers[4]);
}
multiplier (5)
