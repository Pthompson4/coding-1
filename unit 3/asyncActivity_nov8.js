//1. what is string concatenation 
'string concatenation is the process of combining 2 strings together using the + (addition) operator.'
var firstWord='good afternoon'  
var secondWord='coding class'
console.log(firstWord + secondWord)

//2. please list and describe three rules for creating variable names
'Variable names should conform to the formatting rules; camel case, snake case, pascal'
'1. variables cannot start with numbers or symbols. they must start with a letter.'
'2. variable names are case sensitive.'
'3. variable names cannot be a JS keyword / reserved word'

//3. define each of the following variable name formats then provide a code example of how you would write them

// # - camel case - every word after the first word is capitalized- pierreThompson
// # - snake case - every word is seperated with an underscore- pierre_Thompson
// # - pascal case - every word is capitalized- PierreThompson

//4. Find the missing variable for each of the following assignment operaor code snippets
let a = '350'
let b = a*2 

//5. Use the logical operators and evaluate the following variables to get the requested result.

//need to figure out which LOGICAL operator we need to use to print out TRUE
x= 10 // 10
y= 2  // 2
z= y*2 // 4

console.log( x > 1 && z== 4 )
