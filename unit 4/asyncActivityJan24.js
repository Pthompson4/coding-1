//1. numberList = [1,23,56,3,56,3,20,200]

//Create a function that uses a while loop to print/ console.log the list but in reverse order.


function reverseNumbers(){
    var i = 7
    while (i > 0){
        console.log(numberlist)
        i -=1
    }
}
reverseNumbers()


function reverse [1,23,56,3,56,3,20,200] {
    var reverse = 200, 20, 3, 56, 3, 23,1
    while (var reverse 1,23,56,3,56,3,20,200){
        console.log ('reverse' + interval)
        
    }
    console.log("reverse!")
}

//2. Create a countdown timer that takes in an number passed in from a HTML document. Your HTML document should be 
// called countdownLoop.html your countdown timer function should use a while loop
//  that will start the count based on the number you provide and then stop at zero (for example; 
// If I type in the number 5 my countdown timer should output 5,4,3,2,1,0 in the console.log). 
// The numbers counting down should be displayed in the your browsers console (right-click to open the inspect tool 
// and the hover over the icon that says console.)
// Provided below is the html template you can use for your code. The template already has the input field written 
// and will output your entry in the console. You need to finish this code by adding your countdown function. 

// you can write you function between the <script> tags OR you can use the src 
// attribute and import your js file into your html file.
